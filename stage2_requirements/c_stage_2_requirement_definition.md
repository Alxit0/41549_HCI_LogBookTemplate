# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Maria goes on a Museum Tour

[Maria had always loved modern art, but she often found museum visits overwhelmingâ€”so many exhibits, so much information, and little guidance on where to start. Today, she was visiting a contemporary art museum that had recently introduced an **interactive guide**.  ]

[As she entered the museum, Maria received a notification on her phone, reminding her to launch the app. She opened it and was greeted with a personalized welcome screen. The system, aware of her general interests in **digital media and abstract art**, suggested a self-guided tour tailored to her preferences.  ]

[Curious, Maria followed the suggested path. As she approached the first painting, the guide vibrated slightlyâ€”a prompt that additional content was available. Holding up the guide, she saw an **overlay** appear on the screen, revealing a time-lapse animation of the artist creating the piece. A small **audio clip** played, explaining the artistâ€™s thought process and influences. Maria found this fascinating; it was as if the artwork was coming to life in front of her.  ]

[As she continued her tour, Maria **bookmarked** her favorite pieces, leaving notes about what she found intriguing. The system, recognizing her engagement, suggested another exhibit nearby featuring similar themes. Midway through her visit, she received a pop-up asking if sheâ€™d like a **short quiz** on the artworks she had explored, offering an interactive way to reflect on what she had learned.  ]

  
## Scenario 2: Pedro makes a list very quick

[Pedro doesn't like to lose time when's unnecessary and money no longer a problem to him so he would like to create a general list, specifying only a few products. After that he would also like to look for the closest supermarket, using price as a tiebreaker]

[He quickly opens the app and starts writing down **general products** he wants such as milk, cookies, cereals... He also **specifies some other products** because he likes them better than the others]

[As he's running out of ideas he goes to the **recomended section** and notices that he didn't put bananas into his list so he quickly adds them]

[At last he **saves the list** and looks for the **reccomended supermarket**, **priorityzing the closest**]

## Scenario 3: Pedro reuses a list

[Since he grew up, Pedro's always been a guy with no time to waste. Since he has a company to run, he's always busy and can't manage to waste time doing unimportant things. Today, as he was having lunch, he remembered he needed to go to the market and so he opened the app.]

[As he had to do it quick he went to the lists he **saved** before and **reused** one, but he noticed that the yogurt's price had gone increased so he **edited** the list, swapping the yogurt he had chosen for other from other brand, one that was cheaper.]

[Before saving the list, he remembered that this time he also needed toothpaste and 2 boxes of cereals, so he quickly **searched and added** them to the list.]

[Once he remembered that he actually needs to use this list once a month because of the 2 things he added, he **saves the list as a copy**, keeping the one he first reused.]


## Scenario 4: Pedro goes shopping

[Pedro just finished another busy day of work and is needs to go to a market using a list that he made previously]

[As soon as he enters the supermarket he opens the app an uses the list. As he grabs the things he needs he **marks its checkboxes** to know what he bougth and what he didn't.]

[He notices that by accident he added meat when doing the list so he edits the list to **remove it** and keeps buying]

[After paying, he selects the **option to finish the shopping list (unchecking all the checkboxes)** and **saves the list, overwriting** the one with the meat mistake]
